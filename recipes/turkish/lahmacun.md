## Ingredients

- All-purpose flour [3 cups]
- Warm water [1 cup]
- Salt [1 teaspoon]
- Sugar [1 teaspoon]
- Olive oil [1 tablespoon]
- Ground beef [200g]
- Grated onion [1]

- Crushed pepper [1 teaspoon]
- Black pepper [1 teaspoon]
- Finely chopped parsley [1/2 bunch]

## Instructions

1.  In a large bowl, mix the flour, salt, and sugar. Gradually add the warm water and olive oil, and knead until you have a soft dough.
2.  Cover the dough and let it rest for at least 3 hours, or overnight in the refrigerator.
3.  While the dough is resting, prepare the filling. Combine the ground beef, grated onion, grated tomatoes, pepper paste, tomato paste, crushed pepper, black pepper, parsley, salt, garlic, and hot peppers in a bowl and mix well.
4.  Preheat your oven to 250°C (475°F).
5.  Divide the dough into small balls. On a floured surface, roll each ball into a thin oval or round shape.
6.  Spread a thin layer of the filling over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.
7.  Place the lahmacun on a baking sheet and bake for 6-8 minutes, or until the edges are crispy and golden brown.
8.  Serve immediately with a squeeze of lemon juice and a side of fresh parsley and onion.

## Fast Hack

1.  Use a KitchenAid mixer with a dough hook to knead the dough.
2.  Use a blender to quickly chop the vegetables for the filling.
3.  A pasta attachment for the KitchenAid mixer can be used to roll out the dough quickly and evenly. Use number 6 setting for thickness.
