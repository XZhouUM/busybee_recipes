## Cooking Time

- Active Cooking Time: 15 minutes
- Total Cooking Time: 50 minutes

### Efficiency Tools

- Air fryer

### Ingredients

- Yellow Croaker [8 units]
- Salt [1 tablespoon]
- Onion [0.5 clove]
- Flour [1 tablespoon]
- Starch [1 tablespoon]
- Baking soda [0.5 grams]
- Cumin [1 tablespoon]
- Water [60-70 grams]
- Olive oil

### Instructions
1.  Thoroughly clean the yellow croakers and pat them completely dry with paper towels to ensure a crispy finish.
2.  Gently massage the salt all over the fish.
3.  Thinly slice the onion and toss it with the fish. Let it marinate for at least 15 minutes to absorb the flavors.
4.  While the fish is marinating, whisk together the flour, starch, baking soda, and cumin in a medium bowl.
5.  Gradually pour in the water while mixing until you have a smooth, lump-free batter.
6.  Remove the onion slices from the fish. Dip each fish into the batter, ensuring a light and even coating.
7.  Line your air fryer basket with aluminum foil and lightly brush it with olive oil.
8.  Arrange the coated fish in a single layer in the basket, without overcrowding.
9.  Air fry at 400°F (200°C) for 10 minutes.
10. Carefully flip the fish and continue to air fry for another 8-10 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through.
11. Serve immediately for the best taste and texture.
