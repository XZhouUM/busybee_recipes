## Cooking Time

- Active Cooking Time: 5 minutes
- Total Cooking Time: 15 minutes

## Ingredients

- Any vegetables
- Egg [1 unit]
- Salt [1 teaspoon]
- Green onion [1 unit] (optional)

## Instructions

1. Prepare vegetables of your choice, and cut them into small pieces. Some suggestions include:

    - 4 tomatoes
    - Some seaweed (they expand after boiling, so use sparingly; also no need to cut them)
    - 1 cucumber
    - 1 bok choy

2. Beat an egg in a small bowl.

3. Boil water in a pot and add the prepared vegetables.

4. Once the water is boiling again, slowly pour the beaten egg in a circular motion to ensure it spreads evenly, rather than forming a single clump.

5. Season with 1 teaspoon of salt and, optionally, 1 chopped green onion.

6. Cook until the egg is fully set. This is generally quite fast if your water is boiling, such as 30 seconds.
