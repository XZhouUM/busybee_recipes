# Oven-Roasted Chestnuts

## Cooking Time

- Active Cooking Time: 15 minutes
- Total Cooking Time: 35 minutes

## Ingredients

- Raw chestnuts with shell [500 grams]
- Cooking oil [1 tablespoon]
- White sugar [20 grams]
- Water [10 grams]

## Instructions

1.  **Preparation:** Rinse the chestnuts and pat them dry.
2.  **Scoring:** This is a crucial step. Use a knife to cut a cross on the surface of each chestnut. The cut must be deep enough to break the outer shell. This prevents the chestnuts from exploding due to internal pressure during roasting and makes them easier to peel later. Be careful, as the chestnuts can be slippery.
3.  **Preheat Oven:** Preheat your oven to 200°C (390°F).
4.  **Coat with Oil:** Place the scored chestnuts in a bowl, add the cooking oil, and mix well to ensure each chestnut is coated with a thin layer of oil. This helps prevent them from burning.
5.  **First Roast:** Spread the chestnuts in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with foil, with the cuts facing up. Place them in the preheated oven and roast for about 20-25 minutes.
6.  **Prepare Sugar Glaze (Optional):** While the chestnuts are roasting, prepare the sugar water. Mix the white sugar and water and heat until the sugar is completely dissolved.
7.  **Glaze and Final Roast:** Remove the baking sheet from the oven. Use a brush to apply the sugar water evenly over the chestnuts, especially on the scored openings. Return the baking sheet to the oven and roast for another 5 minutes.
