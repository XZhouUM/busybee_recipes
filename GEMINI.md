## Project Overview

This project is a collection of recipes in Markdown format. The goal is to create a simple, easy-to-use, and interactive recipe book for people who are crazily busy but still want to eat healthy home-cooked food.

## Recipe Format

The recipes in this project start with the section Cooking Time, which feature short active cooking time (i.e., the time a person is actively involved in the cooking process). Sometimes the total cooking time can be much longer than the active cooking time, but the rest of the cooking time is fully hands-off and without any supervision. Tools needed to create the fully hands-off cooking time is also provided in the Efficiency Tools section of each recipe.

## User Goals

The user wants to be able to easily search, select, and filter recipes based on their preferences. They also want to be able to easily obtain the details of a recipe, including the ingredients, instructions, and cooking time. The user may also want to translate the recipe into their native languages.

## Important Files

The recipes are designed intentionally to be multi-cultural so that more diversity is provided. All receipes are contained in folders based on their origin.

Example:
- `Chinese/`: This directory contains Chinese recipes.
- `Turkish/`: This directory contains Turkish recipes.
