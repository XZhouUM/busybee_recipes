# Mushroom Chicken Soup

## Cooking Time

- Active cooking time: 15 minutes
- Ready in:
  - 1 hour 40 minutes
  - With fast hack: 40 minutes

## Ingredients

- Chicken [0.5][Chopped]
- Dried mushrooms [Any (shiitake mushrooms, bamboo fungus, cordyceps flower, tea tree mushrooms, morels, chanterelles, king oyster mushrooms)]
- Scallions
- Ginger
- Goji berries
- Red dates

## Instructions

1. Soak dried mushrooms in warm water for 20 minutes.

2. Rinse and drain the chopped chicken thoroughly.

3. Heat oil in a wok and sauté ginger slices and scallions until fragrant. Add the chicken and stir-fry over medium heat, stirring constantly, until lightly browned.

4. Bring water to a boil in a casserole. Add the sautéed chicken, scallions, and ginger slices. Once the water returns to a boil, skim off any foam. Cover and reduce heat to low, simmer for 1 hour. Add the mushrooms and red dates and continue to simmer for 30 minutes.

5. Add the goji berries and salt and simmer for 10 minutes.

## Fast Hack

1. Use chopped chicken from the store. Never chop your own chicken. The cleaning-up afterwards is a pain.

2. Starting from step 4, instead of simmering the soup over open fire, you can use a pressure cooker. Add all the ingredients to the pressure cooker and cook for 20 minutes.

3. You can use an automated pressure cooker to make it even easier for you. Use the soup preset and let it run by itself.
