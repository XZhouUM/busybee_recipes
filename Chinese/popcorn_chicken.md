## Instructions

1. Cut the chicken thighs into bite-sized cubes.
2. In a bowl, combine the chicken cubes with soy sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, salt, pepper, sesame oil, and garlic powder. Mix well to ensure the chicken is evenly coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2-3 hours to marinate.
3. Whisk the egg and mix it into the marinated chicken.

6. Arrange the coated chicken cubes in a single layer in the air fryer basket. Brush some oil on the chicken cubes. Avoid overcrowding; cook in batches if necessary.
7. Air fry for 12 minutes, flipping the chicken cubes halfway through the cooking time, until they are golden brown, crispy, and cooked through.
